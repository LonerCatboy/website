          Well, if you clicked on that button (or link, or whatever, yo're visiting MY website) that's probably the
          case. Well guess what, I guess it's sort of your lucky day because it happens I am looking for friends myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you happen to fall - just like me - in the orange section of the following graph?
        </p>

        <p>
          This is a meme which, in one form or another, is often published on the r/introvert subreddit quite a lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Well, here i offer/present <span class="attention">the obvious solution</span>. Here it is:
        </p>
        <p>
          1 - You have a look around here to decide wether I sound decently interesting to you <br>
          2 - You make contact with me (you do that by clicking the "I want to befriend you" button at the end of the
          page) <br>
          3 - We see where this goes <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          That's it. So easy. Totally free. No terms and conditions. Like it might be a life changer for both of us.
          Like I'm totally dead serious I spent an embarassing amount of time preparing this whole thing.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're getting bored, there's a player with some music to listen to while reading here. Unless you're on mobile. It
          doesn't appear on mobile. Sorry. Use a proper computing device next time pls. Music is sourced from YouTube. On pc, you can drag that thing around. 
          Or just skip to the end of the page, or whatever.

                What's a friend? It could be or imply many things actually. I'm quite open minded in that regard. <b>I'd
                  led you decide what you want this thing to be. </b>
              </p>
              <p>
                - Gaming buddy? Ok, why not. <br>
                - Platonic standard male friendship? Well that sounds fine to me. <br>
                - Bromance? Well I guess you gotta be open minded these days. Just don't be a creep. <br>
                - Full fledge romantic relationship? Well that's not what I'm looking for but I guess one never know.
                <br>
                - Something else? Fine! It's up to you
              </p>
              <p><b>
                  I mean this doesn't sound like a deal to you I don't know what would do. I bet it must sounds almost
                  too
                  good to be true.
              </p></b>

              <p>
                I know what you're thinking now. It must be one of the following: <br>
                - ¬´Oh, wow, this guy is weird af¬ª <br>
                - ¬´Uhm, sure... I guess by the time I am reading this he'll surely have found someone, no point to try¬ª
                <br>
                - ¬´I'm still not sure if this is a joke or not¬ª
              </p>

              <p>
                <b> Well, in order: </b> <br>
                - Yes I am, but you gotta believe me IRL I look way more normal than what I sound like here. <br>
                - NO!! That's just an excuse you're making for yourself. If this page is online (look! we're on the
                internet! so cool!) whatever I wrote here is still valid. Also I'm looking for like more than one
                friend, like, the ideal number would be 3. Me exluded, so a group of 4. I will remove this page, when
                irrelevant. <br>
                - It is not. Listen dude I am just lone,y, afraid of people and I wanted to create a website for myself.
                Therefore I thought, why don't try to combine these things into one? Huh, actually I also wanted to
                write a webnovel but I dunno if I'll continue that bruh. <br>

              <p>
                I'm fearful like a stray cat (pls don't laugh). Afraid of the dark, huh. A bit asocial in the sense that
                in many situations I'd rather stay at home than going in a place with people.
              </p>
              <p>
                I may be slightly agoraphobic. <br>
                As for the rest, I'm the normal average guy you'd meet huh IDK at the grocery store?
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm curious by nature, and I rarely encounter topics I'm actively uninterested in. But that's not
                important, I'm not looking for a person to discuss, I'm looking for a person to play, doing stuff AND
                discuss.<br>
                I like cats and most animals (NOT SNAKES). But I'm not vegan or anything. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't ghost or anything and I have really few dealbreakers: <br>
                I don't tolerate arrogance and people who don't respect boundaries, that's it. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Am I free from negative sides? No, not at all. I try my best.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm not competitive and I mostly dislike competition/pvp. I strongly prefer cooperation in general.
                Working together with someone to reach a goal.
              </p>

              <p>
                <i><b>What I like:</b></i> <br> <br>

                Nature. It might be a clich√©, idk what to say about that. I'm particularly comfortable in forests with
                no people. <br> <br>
                I'm interested in old consumer and media technology, especially from the 70s and 80s and 90s. <br>
                I'm also interested in old HiFi systems (don't worry though I'm not an audiophile). <br> <br>
                And also scifi, animation, data hoarding, history (I like listening to podcast), architecture (perhaps
                my next major but I'm not sure), and many more things I don't even remember now. <br>
                I enjoy fantasy anime and even isekais from time to time. <br>
                Pretty much everything but fitness and pseudosciences. <br>
                I like relaxing games.

                - Sexting. I mean it'd be tolerable within the scope of a roleplay but I'd prefer to focus on other
                things. <br>
                - I'm not open to online romantic relationship.

                - Almost any kind of sandbox game. <br><br>
                - Minecraft is goat. I usually play vanilla but I woudn't dislike playing modded, I'd like to try the
                create mod. <br>
                I CAN HOST A SERVER (only vanilla for now). And like, I'm not jelaous like if you wanna a copy of the
                world
                I'll
                give that to you, like a backup huh, but don't use that to cheat (it'd ruin the game)!
              </p>

              <p>
                - More advanced sandbox games (Space Engineers, Scrap Mechanic, others...) are ok too.
              </p>
              <p>


                - Life sims and cozy games of any kind (Stardew Valley, and so on) totally up to as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Survival games (Raft) also into those. Especially if building is involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                - FPS and similar I haven't played them for a while and I was never good, but I think I own Battlefield
                V and
                some others. Haven't opened them in years. I used to like TF2.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Horror co-op: I have a bunch of those! They're quite enjoying and great to break the ice. I own
                Phasmophobia and Lethal Company
              </p>
              <p>
                - Party games I have some, they're fine as fillers or with many people
              </p>
              <p>
                - Co-ops of any kind. If we collaborate for a shared goal I'm fine
              </p>
              <p>
                - Management games (though most of them are singleplayer only huh)
              </p>
              <p>
                - I don't know where to put it but I used to love Sea of Thieves. Though I stopped playing it actively
                shortly after the anniversary update.
              </p>
              <p>
                - I have a job so buying games for me generally isn't a problem. <br>I also own a Switch but that's more
                for
                offline activities, I don't pay for NSO sorry.

                Neither I do. A small presentation will be great. If really nothing comes to your mind just state your
                name. It's reasonable for me to assume you have one?
                If you don't wanna state your name state your username. L-like I don't know sir it's not like I'm an
                expert or something. Like LOOK at what I had to do here!
