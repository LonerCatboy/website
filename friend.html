          Look at you (how cute!!), reading at those line with that confused expression on your face. I can only imagine
          what's crossing your mind right now. Perhaps you're wondering, is the author of this thing serious? Is this
          meant to be taken as a joke?
        </p>
        <p>
          In actuality, despite being presented in a humorous way, the reality behind this page is deeply serious. The
          most serious thing of all.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, let's unravel this. Perhaps - and I'm only assuming - you, my dear internaut fellow, fell just like me
          within the orange portion on the following graph:

        <p>
          Perhaps you think people are weird. Society is hostile. Or perhaps you don't think that at all. Humans are
          wonderful creatures.
          I really really like this font. It's barely readable but it's so 90s, vibes. That's why I'm writing
          nonsensical stuff. To fill this page with wonderful unreadable text.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok let's get back to buisness. You want a friend, or maybe a partner. Both are good. Both are available. Look
          at you is your lucky day.

                - Bromance? Well I guess you gotta be open minded these days. Just don't be a creep. <br>
                - Full fledge romantic relationship? Well, better take your chance now! I won't be free forever!

              <p>
                Full compatibility doesn't exist. If we have fun together and

              <p>
                I'm fearful like a stray cat (pls don't laugh). Afraid of the dark, huh. A bit asocial in the sense that
                in many situations I'd rather stay at home than going in a place with people.
              </p>
              <p>
                I may be slightly agoraphobic. <br>
                As for the rest, I'm the normal average guy you'd meet huh IDK at the grocery store?
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm curious by nature, and I rarely encounter topics I'm actively uninterested in. But that's not
                important, I'm not looking for a person to discuss, I'm looking for a person to play, doing stuff AND
                discuss.<br>
                I like cats and most animals (NOT SNAKES I HATE THOSE THINGS). But I'm not vegan or anything. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                I don't ghost or anything and I have really few dealbreakers: <br>
                I don't tolerate arrogance and people who don't respect boundaries. <br>
              </p>
              <p>
                Am I free from negative sides? No, not at all. I try my best.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm not competitive and I mostly dislike competition/pvp. I strongly prefer cooperation in general.
                Working together with someone to reach a goal. So no, I won't play PVP with you. Though I'd make an
                exception with racing games.

                <i><b>Things I like:</b></i> <br> <br>

                Nature. It might be a clich√©, idk what to say about that. I'm particularly comfortable in forests with
                no people. <br> <br>
                I'm interested in old consumer and media technology, especially from the 70s and 80s and 90s. <br>
                I'm also interested in old HiFi systems (don't worry though I'm not an audiophile). <br> <br>
                And also scifi, animation, data hoarding, history (I like listening to podcast), architecture (perhaps
                my next major but I'm not sure), and many more things I don't even remember now. <br>
                I enjoy fantasy anime and even isekais from time to time. <br>
                Pretty much everything but fitness and pseudosciences. <br>
                I like relaxing games.

                - Visiting shops. Any shop it'd be ok. If I had to pick I'd say thrift stores, and maybe manga stores.

                deal with my body, which doesn't weight a lot but I guess it'd be super annoying to drag around.<br>
                - Going to the beach / sea. Not really my thing. I get bored staying there all day, then sand is sticky
                and it gets everywhere and it's uncomfortable. I'm more a mountain/forest guy. <br>

              <p>I'm not a fan of fighting games, card games, and stuff like that. Other than that I particularly enjoy:
              </p>
              <p>
                - Almost any kind of sandbox game. <br><br>
                - Minecraft is goat. I usually play vanilla but I woudn't dislike playing modded, I'd like to try the
                create mod. <br>
                I CAN HOST A SERVER (only vanilla for now). And like, I'm not jelaous like if you wanna a copy of the
                world
                I'll
                give that to you, like a backup huh, but don't use that to cheat (it'd ruin the game)!
              </p>

              <p>
                - More advanced sandbox games (Space Engineers, Scrap Mechanic, others...) are ok too.
              </p>
              <p>


                - Life sims and cozy games of any kind (Stardew Valley, and so on) totally up to as well.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Survival games (Raft) also into those. Especially if building is involved.
              </p>
              <p>
                - FPS and similar I haven't played them for a while and I was never good, but I think I own Battlefield
                V and
                some others. Haven't opened them in years. I used to like TF2.
              </p>
              <p>
                - Horror co-op: I have a bunch of those! They're quite enjoying and great to break the ice. I own
                Phasmophobia and Lethal Company
              </p>
              <p>
                - Party games I have some, they're fine as fillers or with many people
              </p>

                for
                offline activities, I don't pay for NSO sorry.

            I mean, if you're a man that's not even entirely possible in Italy. <br>
            Also you skipped too many steps. Try another button.
          </p>
          <p>
            I mean actually, with proper time, uhh, well IDK, I mean reach me out and we can discuss it. Like seriously.
            Why not after all. Build something together. Please be a male 21 to 35 in decent shape and not a creep.
            Though if you're really considering this option right ahead you're probably a lil bit weird. Yeah not a
            great idea after all. Definitely not. You don't marry strangers do you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Ok actually this was meant to be the joke option. I don't even like too much the idea of marrying.
