        Looking for friends? Great (me too). This is a great place to start. Don't dare to go away!

      <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
        Sooo first of all, pls note that I'll be more scared of you than you're scared of me. <br>
        As you may have guessed at this point I do not excel in forming connections with people. In fact I'm
        rather clueless. <br> But bruh - they say - humans needs social interactions to work and yadda yadda yadda...
        yeah sure, you'll have read this hungreds of times didn't ya? <br>
        <br>
        Now, many of you (I assume you come from reddit) will certainly be familiar with the following meme format,
        representing the condition afflicting many of us: <br><br>

        <img src="resources/graphs/introvertmeme.png" class="narrow-700 img-decor clickable-image"
          onclick="makeEffect('hit')"> <br><br>

        This is a meme which was in one form or another published on the r/introvert subreddit quite a lot. <br> <br>

        As can clearly be seen in this graphical representation of loneliness, which to be completely fair I
        originally
        imagined it to be way funnier than this, I happened to fall into that
        category of introvert/asocial/weirdos which mostly failed to find someone to be friend with (actually that's
        not
        completely true but I'll elaborate later or after we meet if relevant). <br>
        <br>
        It happens! <br>
        <br>
        And pherhaps... this also apply to <span class="class glow-blink">you!</span> <br> <br> Otherwise why are you
        here!? Go spend time with your actual friends you slutty not-friendless whore! <br>
        <br>
        So, as an engineer, I like to think of me like a <span class="attention">solution oriented
          individual</span>. <br>


        <br>
        Therefore, here's like it's gonna work. If you feel like, read around, and then just DM me.
        Like you'd do with a normal person which I definitely am.
        <br> <br>
        What I offer is some kind of relationship which may or may not evolve into a friendship at some point. No
        terms
        and conditions.

            </h1>

            <p class=" sub-content-small narrow-700">
              What's a friend? It could be or imply many things actually. I'm quite open minded in that regard but
              you'd
              decide. What's
              important now though it's not what a friendship could eventually be but rather what a friendship
              tipically
              is <i> at the beginning.</i> <br>
              <br>
              And that's very straightforward. I'm looking for a person with whom <span>
                <b>
                  playing games, watching anime, or in general, doing activities </b> </span>. Doing stuff

              That's the core. Other things require at least a minimal amount of time to develop. <br> <br>

              I'm fearful like a stray cat (pls don't laugh). Afraid of the dark, huh. A bit asocial in the sense that
              in many situations
              I'd rather stay at home than going in a place with people. <br> <br>
              I'm curious by nature, and there are very few topics I'm actively uninterested in.<br> <br>
              I like cats and most animals (NOT SNAKES). But I'm not vegan or anything. <br>
              <br>
              I don't ghost or anything and I have really few dealbreakers: <br>
              I don't tolerate arrogance and people who don't respect boundaries, that's it. <br> <br>

              <br> <br>

              <i><b>What I like:</b></i> <br> <br>

              I'm interested in old consumer and media technology, especially from the 70s and 80s and 90s. <br>
              I'm also interested in old HiFi systems (don't worry though I'm not an audiophile). <br> <br>
              And also scifi, animation, data hoarding, history (I like listening to podcast), architecture (perhaps
              my
              next major but I'm not sure), and many more things I don't remember now. <br>
              I enjoy fantasy anime and isekais from time to time. <br>
              Pretty much everything but fitness and pseudosciences. <br>

              - Roleplaying (I'd be a beginner, wether we'd do that in italian or in english) <br>
              - Starting a hobby project (a simple game, a novel, or other things). This one later though, I'm a bit

              <b>In real life:</b> <br> <br>
              - All of the above but in the same room. Better if in a cozy place. <br>
              - Hiking in nature (south Sardinia) <br>
              - Playing game in split screen (Mario Kart and stuff like that) <br>
              - Visiting museums, or cities, or villages, or places <br>
              - Visiting shops. Any shop it'd be ok. If I had to pick I'd say thrift stores, and maybe manga shops
              <br>
              - Any other activity which is proposed unless it fall under... <br> <br> <br>

              ‚ùå<span><b>Stuff I'd prefer to avoid instead: <br><br>Online: </b></span> <br> <br>
              - Sexting. I mean it'd be tolerable within the scope of a roleplay but I'd prefer to focus on other
              things. <br>
              - I'm not open to online romantic relationship. <br>
              <br>
              <b>In real life:</b> <br> <br>
              - Going to disco, parties, or crowed noisy places. Pls no. <br>
              - Going to the beach / sea. Not really my thing. I get bored staying there all day, then sand is sticky
              and it gets everywhere and it's uncomfortable. I'm more a mountain/forest guy. <br>

              - I'm ok for any kind of sandbox game. <br><br>
              - Minecraft is goat. I usually play vanilla but I woudn't dislike playing modded, I'd like to try the
              create mod. <br>
              I CAN HOST A SERVER (only vanilla for now). And like, I'm not jelaous like if you wanna a copy of the
              world
              I'll
              give that to you, like a backup huh, but don't use that to cheat (it'd ruin the game)!


              <br><br>

              - More advanced sandbox games (Space Engineers, Scrap Mechanic, others...) are ok too. <br><br>

              - Life sims and cozy games of any kind (Stardew Valley, and so on) totally up to as well. <br> <br>

              - Survival games (Raft) also into those. Especially if building is involved. <br> <br>

              - FPS and similar I haven't played them for a while and I was never good, but I think I own Battlefield
              V
              and
              some others. Haven't opened them in years. I used to like TF2. <br> <br>

              - Horror co-op: I have a bunch of those! They're quite enjoying and great to break the ice. I own
              Phasmophobia and
              Lethal Company <br> <br>

              - Party games I have some, they're fine as fillers or with many people <br> <br>

              - Co-ops of any kind. If we collaborate for a shared goal I'm fine <br> <br>

              - Management games (though most of them are singleplayer only huh)<br> <br>

              - I don't know where to put it but I used to love Sea of Thieves. Though I stopped playing it actively
              shortly after the anniversary update. <br> <br>

              - I have a job so buying games for me generally isn't a problem. <br>I also own a Switch but that's more
              for
              offline activities, I don't pay for NSO sorry.
