      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Loner Catboy, also know as LC. Huh, no actually that isn't true but "EL C" sounds somewhat cool huh. <br>
        I'm a computer scientist for half a day and a loner lost soul for the other
        half, whatever that means.
      </p>
      <h2>
        About me...
      </h2>
      <p>Assuming I am alive, I am now a <span id="age">[please enable javascript]</span> years old boy/man.</p>

      <p>
        I live and work full time in Sardinia, Italy. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I like to imagine fictional scenarios (and sometimes write them down!) play games, read things
        here and
        there, listen to music, y'know the typical sort of asocial weirdo kind of stuff! <br>
        I'm also studying a bit of Japanese, huh and I'm currently down for a master degree in AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah I'm huh, trying to cram a lot of things at once actually though I sort of have many interests. <br>
        I also collect vintage audio equipment, and in general, I collect things that get my attention. <br>

            is.</em>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Oh, I also have a small collection of manga, even though I haven't bought new ones for a while (I'm broke rip).
        I also enjoy anime, even though I haven't watched a lot lately. I loved Frieren and Yuri on ice (bruh I'm not
        gonna update this page very much thus probably I've watched other ones already huh!) <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        As for music I like JPop and listen to it quite a lot. <br>
        Though I kinda like pop in general, particularly from the 70 to 90. <br>
        Here a list of JPop / JRock artists I like (huh, again I'm not gonna update this very often or at all)

          Now this dude is like the goat, he talks about the most boring stuff ever like telephones, modedms, vintage
          computers and so on, but it does that
          with such a good storytelling you'll end up listening for hours to the most random anedotes about the history
          of technology. <br>
          Which is like, the best kind of history. <br>

          Not much to say about it, you probably already know him. He reviews cool old stuff, though he's mostly
          focused on audio equipment and vintage hifi. He's chill, his videos are relaxing with a touch of sillyness
          from time
          to time. Just lovely as a person.

          I don't remeber how I found this serie, made by the youtuber HyperCubist, but I've found it quite intriguing
          especially the later episodes. This serie aim to the goal of helping the viewer visualizing 4dimensional
          space and geometry and it does that really well. <br>
          There isn't much math involved either. Though it requires at least a bit of focus. Especially the later
          episodes.

          THE CUTEST CHANNEL OF ALL!! <br>
          This is a new discovery, so I really don't have much to say. This one I link is the only video I've viewed.
          It's
          another math channel (I'm not that much into pop math but somehow yt keeps recommending it to me). <br>
          The catch here is that the problem are explained by two super cute anime characters, and they have like a
          supeeeeerr cute voice, like it's so lovely. It's obviously fake yet so cute.
          The math is (as it happens with most pop-math content) quite basic and easy to follow.

        </p>
        <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
          Actually these aren't even all, there are a lot of youtubers I follow but some of them are so ubiquitous I
          don't think it'd be interesting to list them. Like, I won't list TechnologyConnections or Kurzgesagt.

      <h1>
        F.A.Q.
      </h1>
      <h2>
        Why is your reddit username "MiserableLonerCatboy"? That sound weird and bad.
      </h2>
      <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
        Well two main reasons actually: <br>
        First, I was in a slightly bad mood the day I created that account, more than one year ago. <br>
        Second, most importantly, it was supposed to be like a burner account for NSFW but I never used it like that.
        <br>
        I liked the Catboy part though. Not that I wear cat ears in public (I wish I had that confidence!!!!!) <br>
        So, despite the fact I am not a Catboy irl, I feel comfortable interacting online under a pseudonym which refer
        to
        that. <br>
        Is that a crime? <br>
        I wish I could change it but that's not possible and I'm not gonna create another account. <br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>
        So you're like a nerd, ya look like a discord moderator or smth?
      </h2>
      <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
        I said I don't look like a catboy in the sense that perhaps I'm not that cute, but no, I do not look like a
        meme (at least I hope so huh!).
        IRL, I look like a rather typical guy. No posture issues, skinny, clean. Plain normal, 100% not weirdo.
        A lil bit on the smaller size. Someone might consider that cute. <br>
        Said someone should definitely check out the page "looking for a friend?" in the header. <br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>
        So what's this whole thing about? A page about you? Are you a narcissist or smth?
      </h2>
      <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
        This page is a mean of <span class="attention"> self expression. </span> You probably use one yourself, on a
        platform like instagram or whatever. You do you, but a page about me must have the layout and UX I decide. <br>
        People used to to that all the time, I guess, before socials. I don't like social very much. I don't
        particularly enjoy reddit either but it's the only way to interact with others. <br>
        Call this a safe space or something. <br> <br>
        You are allowed to clone this website and make your own modyfiying mine if ya want. Like we could create a <er>
          webring </er> if ya want. That would be fun. So like the site is super open source. Kinda like me.<br> <br>
        Oh yeah and maybe there'll be a blog (I'll mostly publish guides on how to pirate stuff teheheheeh!!!!) and
        maybe something else, work is in progress.
      </p>

      <p></p>
      <h2>
        Ok so this is just a personal blog and you're a perfecly normal person. But what about cookies?
      </h2>
      <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
        Cookies are used here and there to save stuff. Like, if you click on "change theme" in the header that save a small tiny tiny cookie to remember it. If you use the audio player in some page it generates a bit of cookies to store stuff like what you were listening, and stuff. <br>
        There shouldn't be third parties cookies but if you find some pls DM me, I'm not a developer actually.
