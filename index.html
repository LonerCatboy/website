      <h1>Hi there!</h1>
      <p>
        I'm Loner Catboy, also know as LC. I'm a computer scientist for half a day and a loner lost soul for the other
        half <em>(does this sound badass? No? Oh.) </em>.
      </p>
      <h2>
        A bit about me...
      </h2>
      <p>Assuming I am alive, I am now a <span id="age">[please enable javascript]</span> years old boy/man.</p>

      <p>
        I live and work full time in Sardinia, Italy. <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time I like to imagine scenarios (and sometimes write them down!) play games, read things here and
        there, y'know the typical sort of asocial weirdo kind of stuff! <br>
        I'm also studying a bit of Japanese, huh and I'm currently down for a master degree in AI.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah I'm huh, trying to cram a lot of things at once actually though I sort of have many interests. <br>
        Oh! Uhm, as you might have guessed by looking at this page huh I like cool vintage stuff. I'm mainly
        interested in
        vintage audio equipment though.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oh, I also have a small collection of manga, even though I haven't bought new ones for a while (I'm broke
        rip).
        I also enjoy anime, even though I haven't watched a lot lately. I loved Frieren and Yuri on ice (bruh I'm not gonna update this page very much thus probably I've watched other ones already huh!) <br>
        <br>
      </p>
      <p>
        As for music I like JPop and listen to it quite a lot. <br>
        Though I kinda like pop in general, particularly from the 70 to 90. Here a list of JPop / JRock artists I like

          Now, this dude's videos are long—like, an hour or more, most of them. But he's just so interesting that
          you’ll
          watch a whole hour and feel like only ten minutes have passed.
          He really does have a talent for storytelling. He could talk about the most boring topic imaginable, and
          you’d
          still be hooked from start to finish. <br>
          Wanna deep down into the history of <em>scanners</em>? Or perhaps you wanna see the weirdest mouse you've
          never
          seen? No? <br>
          Yeah it doesn't sound that exciting does it? That's why he'll blew your mind. Or perhaps I'm just a mega
          nerd
          myself.

          Not much to say about it, you probably already know him. He reviews cool old stuff, though he's mostly
          focused
          on audio equipment and vintage hifi. He's chill, his videos are relaxing with a touch of sillyness from time
          to
          time. Just lovely.

          I don't remeber how I found this serie, made by the youtuber HyperCubist, but I've found it quite intriguing
          especially the later episodes. This serie aim to the goal of helping the viewer visualizing 4dimensional
          space
          and geometry and it does that really well. <br>
          There isn't much math involved either. Though it requires at least a bit of focus.

          THE CUTEST CHANNEL OF ALL!! <br>
          This is a new discovery, so I really don't have much to say. This one I link is the only video I've viewed.
          It's
          another math channel (I'm not that much into pop math but somehow yt keeps recommending it to me). <br>
          The catch here is that the problem are explained by two super cute anime characters, and they have like a
          supeeeeerr cute voice, like it's so lovely. It's obviously fake yet so cute.
          The math is (as it happens with most popmath content) quite basic and easy to follow.

      <h1>
        F.A.Q.
      </h1>
      <h2>
        Why is your reddit username "MiserableLonerCatboy"? That sound weird and bad.
      </h2>
      <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
        Well two main reasons actually: <br>
        First, I was in a <em>slightly bad mood</em> the day I created that account, more than one year ago. <br>
        Second, most importantly, it was supposed to be like a burner account for NSFW but I never used it like that.
        <br>
        I liked the Catboy part though. Not that I wear cat ears in public (I wish I had that confidence!!!!!) <br>
        So, despite the fact I am not a Catboy irl, I feel comfortable interacting online under a pseudonym which refer to
        that. <br>
        Is that a crime? 
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>
        So ya look like a discord moderator or smth?
      </h2>
      <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
        I said I don't look like a catboy in the sense that perhaps I'm not that cute, but no, I do not look like a
        meme. At least I hope so.
        IRL, I look like a rather typical guy. No posture issues, skinny, clean. Plain normal, 100% not weirdo.
        A lil bit on the smaller size. Someone might consider that cute. <br>
        Said someone should definitely check out the page "looking for a friend?" in the header. <br>
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>
        So what's this thing about? A page about you? Are you a narcissist or smth?
      </h2>
      <p class="sub-content-small narrow-700">
        This page is a mean of <span class="attention"> self expression. </span> <br>
        People used to to that all the time, I guess, before socials. I don't like social very much. I don't particularly enjoy reddit either but it's the only way to interact with others. <br>
        Call this a safe space or something. <br>
        You are allowed to clone this website and make your own modyfiying mine if ya want. Like we could create a <er> webring </er> if ya want. That would be fun. So like the site is super open source. Kinda like me.<br> <br>
        Oh yeah and maybe there'll be a blog (I'll mostly publish guides on how to pirate stuff teheheheeh!!!!) and maybe something else, work is in progress.
